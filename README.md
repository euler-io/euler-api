Euler File Processing HTTP API ![Release](https://github.com/euler-io/euler-api/workflows/Release/badge.svg)
=========================
[Euler](https://github.com/euler-io/euler) is a Java API built for processing files using concurrent and scalable infrastructure provided by [Akka](https://akka.io/). The main purpose is to extract data from unstructured content such as texts and images using a customizable and plugable task pipeline.

This is the project for the HTTP API. There is currently only one implementation that uses opendistro (elasticsearch) as backend. You can check the docker images at the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eulerio/euler-api-opendistro/tags).
